Project Goals
=============

This project focuses on estimating and predicting the state of charge (SOC) 
and state of health (SOH) for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using a Single 
Particle Model (SPM) in order to reduce the computational cost and allow 
for the model to be implemented in real-time EV LIBs modeling. It accounts 
for the impact of complex parameters such as ion diffusivity, ion particle 
radius, and maximum ion concentration at the ionâ€™s surface on the 
performance of the battery.
