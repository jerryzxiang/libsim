Project Goals
=============

This project focuses on estimating and predicting the state of charge (SOC) 
and state of health (SOH) for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using a Single 
Particle Model (SPM) in order to reduce the computational cost and allow 
for the model to be implemented in real-time EV LIBs modeling. It accounts 
for the impact of complex parameters such as ion diffusivity, ion particle 
radius, and maximum ion concentration at the ionâ€™s surface on the 
performance of the battery.

Modelling these parameters is useful to compare to experimental results. 

Eventually, this project can be expanded to estimate and predict the state 
of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of LIBs, in order to reduce the 
computational cost and allow for the model to be implemented in real-time 
EV LIBs modeling.
