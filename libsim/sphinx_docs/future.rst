Future Work
===========

Graphic User Interface (GUI)
----------------------------

In order to simplify the utilization of libsim, we hope to integrate 
a Graphic User Interface (GUI) to allow for an intuitive user 
experience as opposed to terminal commands.

Tests
-----

With the number of models implemented into libsim, the expected number 
of edge cases and foreseeable issues will also grow. We hope to increase 
the number of tests built into the code in order to reduce the possibility 
for inaccuracies to be generated.

Expanding Models Library
------------------------

The final result of this project allowed for a computationally inexpensive 
model of a reduced order that adapts well for real-time applications. In 
future versions of libsim, we will look to implement PSeudo 2 Dimensional 
(P2D) model aspects to improve accuracy while maintaining time cost in mind.
